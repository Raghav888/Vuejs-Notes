Provide/inject

The two api provide a way to pass data through component tree, without having to pass props. So with help of this we will avoid propn drilling.

Data is provided in parent and injected in child

Parent component

export default{
name:"parent"
data(){
return {
name:"Raghav"
}
},
provide(){
return{
 username:this.name
}
}
}

Child

<template>
<h2>{{username}}</h2>
</template>

export default{

name:"child"
inject:['username']
}

In this way we can avoid prop drilling
