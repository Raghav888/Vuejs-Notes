: makes it v-bind that means disabled value will checked from model, and key in model will be disabled
if it's value is false, then button won't be disabled and viceversa

It can be used with any attribute
ex: 
<div :id="idofDiv"></div>

full synatx

<div v-bind:id="idofDiv"></div>

Also we can use in this way bu ternery operator, and , or



<div :class="soldout? 'green':'red'">helo</div> // in this ex, soldout (boolean) is data property and green/red is classname, whose style is written

<div :class="promoted && 'green' "></div> // in this ex, promted (boolean) i data property and geen is class name


Applying multiple class on based on some condition
Array Approach:

<h2 :class="[isPromoted && 'new',soldout? 'green':'red']" // ispromoted and soldout is boolean data property.

Object Approach
<h2 :class="{new:isPromoted,red:soldout, green:!soldout}" // ispromoted and soldout is boolean data property. If they are true those classes  are applied.
