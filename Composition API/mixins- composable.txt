Mixins is replaced by composables in composition api.

Composables folder contains the files, that will have the logic code.
The naming convention of file is "useFunctionality".

ex:

import {ref} from "vue";

export default function useCounter(){

const count=ref(0)

const increaseValue=()=>{
count.value++
}

return{ count,increaseValue }
}

Now in compoent we can import this and in setup method we will call the useCounter function and destructure it.

setup(){

const {count, increaseValue}=useCounter();
return{count,increaseValue}
}

now in template we can use those.

It solves the problem with mixins, that now we know the var names that composable has.


Also we can send parameter in useCounter function in this way-


import {ref} from "vue";

export default function useCounter(intialvalue=0,steps=1){ // if param are not pased it will use default value

const count=ref(intialvalue)

const increaseValue=()=>{
count.value+=steps
}

return{ count,increaseValue }
}

Nd in component code


setup(){

const {count, increaseValue}=useCounter(100,10);
return{count,increaseValue}
}
