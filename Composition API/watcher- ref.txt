import {watch, ref} from "vue";

setup(){
const name=ref("");

// watch takes two parameter, 1st is var name, second is a function that has two para-> newValue and oldValue.

watch(name,(newValue,oldValue)=>{
 here we write the methods.
})

}

// watchers can watch multiple sources two

it takes array of those var. Ex-


import {watch, ref} from "vue";

setup(){
const name=ref("raghav");
const lastname=ref("bang")

// watch can take array of var also as input and then newvalue, oldvalue is also an array.

watch([name,lastname],(newValue,oldValue)=>{

console.log(newValue[0])// print newvalue of name
console.log(oldValue[0]) // print old value of name
console.log(newValue[1])  // print new value of lastname
console.log(oldValue[1]) // print oldvalue of lastname
 
})

}


// if we want to watch initial values of var, we need to use immediate watchers.

for that watch takes 3rd arguemnt.

watch(varname,()=>{},{
immediate:true
})

// simialry for deep.
