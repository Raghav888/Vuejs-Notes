reactive is used with array/object, basically with nonprimtive datatypes.
ex:

<template>
{{firstname}} {{lastName}}
</template>

setup(){
const state=reactive({ firstname:"Raghav",lastName:"Bang"})
setTimeout(()=>{state.firstname="Ram"},2000)
return toRefs(state) // toRefs is used so that it destrcutures the state and we can directly access the firstname and lastname.
// if we try to return {firstname,lastname} it will not give us the reactivity due to which if its value changes, it is not rer-rendered.
}
