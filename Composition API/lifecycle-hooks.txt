beforeCreate and created is replaced by setup in Composition API

beforeMount by onBeforeMount
mounted byonMounted

beforeUpdate by onBeforeUpdate
updated by onUpdated

beforeUnmount by onBeforeUnmounted
unmounted by OnUnmounted


Those composition lifecycle hooks are used in setup()
Those hooks take a function in it as parameter
ex: onMounted(()=>{})
