It is used when we are using same logic in different components. It conatins our whole js code like data,methods, lifecycle methods, compute,etc.

Mixins is used for reusebality of code as logic is same.


In component where we need tp use those logic ,
in script we add
mixins:[nameofmixin function]

If mixin code  and component code has same name of var, method then componennt var, function is given priority.
