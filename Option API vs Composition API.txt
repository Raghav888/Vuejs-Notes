Options API#
With Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as data, methods, and mounted.
Properties defined by options are exposed on this inside functions, which points to the component instance:

<script>
export default {
  // Properties returned from data() becomes reactive state
  // and will be exposed on `this`.
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },

  // Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.
  // They can be bound as event listeners in templates.
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },

  // Lifecycle hooks are called at different stages
  // of a component's lifecycle.
  // This function will be called when the component is mounted.
  mounted() {
    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>

Composition API are introduced because, all the code grows, project become hard to manage in Option API. It become hard to read through large files as logic is
not grouped by feature. Theyare  grouped by methods, data, compute,etc in option  API.
Another reason is reuse of logic becomes difficult in Option API.

Composition API allows to encapsulate funtionaliy, so that we can use it diff components.
Composition API# Introduced in Vue3
With Composition API, we define a component's logic using imported API functions. In SFCs, Composition API is typically used with <script setup>. The setup attribute is a hint that makes Vue perform compile-time transforms that allow us to use Composition API with less boilerplate. For example, imports and top-level variables / functions declared in <script setup> are directly usable in the template.
Note that setup runs before all lifecycle methods.

Here is the same component, with the exact same template, but using Composition API and <script setup> instead:

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

// reactive state
const count = ref(0)

// functions that mutate state and trigger updates
function increment() {
  count.value++
}

// lifecycle hooks
onMounted(() => {
  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)
})
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>

Which to Choose?#
First of all, both API styles are fully capable of covering common use cases. They are different interfaces powered by the exact same underlying system. In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! The fundamental concepts and knowledge about Vue are shared across the two styles.

The Options API is centered around the concept of a "component instance" (this as seen in the example), which typically aligns better with a class-based mental model for users coming from OOP language backgrounds. It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups.

The Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope, and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity. It is more free-form, and requires understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.
