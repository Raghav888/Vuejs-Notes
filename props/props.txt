v-bind (:) is also used in sending props to child.

<Child msg="It is streing" :info="item"/>

In above ex msg conatins string where as info contains value of item that is in data function.

If in child component we need to makw a prop required then we can do it as well as we can give is default value

ex;
In child component
props:{
titile:{
type:String,
required:true,
default:"It is default title"
}
}
