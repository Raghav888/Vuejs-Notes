In two way binding, the value is in sync in view and model. It makes the connection between both very easily.
If in view the value changes, the value is updated in model and vice versa.

Ex:

<template>
<input type"text" v-model="count"/>
<h1>{{count}}</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default{
name:"nameofComponent"
data(){
return{ count:0}
}}
</script>

In above exmplae, when user types in input bx, the count value changes in view as well as in model
