v-once
 Renders the corresponding HTML elemnt only once. On subsequet render, 
 the elemts is treated as static and skipped. Used for optimization as re-render for that elemnt doesnot happen.
 
 ex:
 <div v-once>{{name}}</div> it will render the name value only once
 <div v-once>Raghav</div>
 
 
 v-pre: It skips compilation for the correspnding element
 
 ex:
 
 <div v-pre>{{name}}</div>
 
 it will print this on screen {{name}}
