id ,class are non prop attriubte. If we apply id or class on child component in parent component , the id/class get applied to child component's outest div.
If there is not outest div, then it id/class wont be applied.

If we want to apply id/class to specfic tag in child compoennet,
we need to add this in that tag
v-bind="$attrs"
and also at same time we dont to apply it to outest div
so we need to add  this in script of child component

inheritAttrs:false
